# It is recommended to add a pkgdown reference index, grouping the different
# function into logical sections (e.g., modules).
# It is also recommended to rely on selector such as `starts_with()` or
# `ends_with()` to create this index as it is a good way to force yourself into
# using a consistent naming convention for your functions.
